# Rails News

Reddit/Hacker News clone using Rails 4 and AngularJS. I followed this tutorial: https://thinkster.io/angular-rails

The idea was to gain a basic understanding of how to integrate Angular in Rails.

### Install

    rake db:migrate
    bower install
    
then start de the server 

    rails s

and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the result!
